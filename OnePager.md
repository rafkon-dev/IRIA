> IRIA is a self-hosted AI assistant designed for private smart homes. It handles local facial and vehicle recognition, presence tracking, and voice interaction through offline STT/TTS. The system integrates n8n automation and works with up to 16 IP cameras and distributed audio nodes. All processing occurs locally, with no external cloud dependencies. Initial prototype runs on Jetson Nano and a Xeon server with 64GB+ RAM.
