# IRIA Project Monetization Strategy

IRIA (Intelligent Residential Infrastructure Assistant) is an open-source, privacy-first AI assistant system designed to run locally on user-owned hardware. While the core platform is open-source and community-driven, the project will support sustainable development through a hybrid monetization strategy outlined below.

## 1. Dual Licensing Model

* **Core IRIA** is free and open-source under a permissive or copyleft license (e.g., AGPLv3).
* **Premium components** (e.g., GUI dashboard, advanced integrations, auto-updater) may be offered under a commercial license for integrators and enterprise users.

## 2. IRIA Hosting / Support Service

* Optional self-hosting support packages:

  * Preinstalled images with OTA updates
  * Web interface for configuration
  * Remote diagnostics (local-only or opt-in encrypted tunnel)
* Monthly plans: \~5–20€ / month
* Target users: non-technical users, privacy enthusiasts, educators

## 3. Hardware Kits and Preconfigured Devices

* Ready-to-use kits including:

  * ESP32 microphones with preflashed firmware
  * Jetson Nano or ARM boards with IRIA OS
  * Local server with preinstalled n8n & IRIA modules
* Sold via own store or 3rd party platforms (e.g., Tindie, Crowd Supply)

## 4. Consulting and Custom Integrations

* For smart homes, small institutions, education:

  * On-site or remote setup
  * Security audits, network integration
  * Custom modules (e.g., for Matter, Zigbee, custom STT)

## 5. Plugin Marketplace

* Modular architecture enables community and premium plugin ecosystem:

  * Free plugins by community
  * Commercial modules (e.g., voice biometrics, home learning assistant, multi-zone control)
  * Payment via GitHub Sponsors, Gumroad or own store

## 6. Community Support and Sponsorship

* GitHub Sponsors page
* BuyMeACoffee / Ko-fi linked in project readme
* Regular blog updates and progress reports
* Annual supporter round with early feature access

## 7. Grant-based Funding

* Actively seeking grants from:

  * NLnet Foundation (applied)
  * NGI Zero / EU open tech initiatives
  * Mozilla Builders / Open Source Collective
* Future rounds planned for expanding offline NLP, accessibility, and multi-language support

## Long-term Vision

> IRIA will remain community-first, user-respecting, and 100% locally operable. Commercial offerings will focus on convenience, support, and additional capabilities – not locking users in.
